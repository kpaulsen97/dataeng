Welcome to the CMC Data Engineering Tech Exercise. We hope you'll enjoy completing it just as much as we've enjoyed doing it for you. Please bare in mind what's most important for us is understanding how you go about problem solving.

Giving just the precise answer or just the adequate code is sufficient, but you can also write an explanation of your solution or strategy, including diagrams, prints, or whatever you see fit. Your repo should be a clone of this one.

Optionally, you can simply send us your solutions by email. Either way, you'll get a chance to add/comment on your solution on the next interview.


Wishing you the best of lucks,
Grateful for your time so far,

**The NN CMC Data Foundation Team**

## exercise 1 DevOps
### exercise 1.1 SSH Clone

A team of chemists needs you to securely clone this repo with an SSH key. Show that you've successfuly cloned and pushed to your cloned public repo by sending us its url. 

*your explanation goes here, include prints wherever you find it appropriate*

### exercise 1.2 Git Ops

The branching policy requires that you branch ``main`` to `dev`, and `dev` to feature branches `exercise21`, `exercise22` and `readme` (see image below).

```
main
│
╰─ dev
    │
    ├─ readme
    ├─ exercise21
    ╰─ exercise22
```

Develop the solution to exercise **2.1** in the ``exercise21`` branch. Commit , push and merge with `dev`. Branch to `exercise22`, develop the solution to exercise **2.2** and repeat the proccess. Don't forget not to delete the branches, we'll be looking at them.

When merging from `exercise22` to `dev`, force some sort of conflict. Explain how you fixed it in the commit message. 

All your edits to this file should me made on the `readme` branch.

After you have finished your exercises, merge to `dev` and then to `main`. We'll be checking the last push before 01:10, 16-05-2021.

## exercise 1.3: Packages

Deploy a python package named `cmc_dataeng_internship_<your-name>` to PyPi. We'll be running `pip install cmc_dataeng_internship_<your-name>` and executing the python package such that:

```python
>>> from cmc_dataeng_internship_<your-name> import exercise13
>>> exercise13.moto()
Coding for our patients.
```

*your explanation goes here, include prints wherever you find it appropriate or code snippets*

## exercise 2 Data Analytics
 You'll find a simple pandas exercise in `data_analytics.py`. The code you find is to be left untouched. You should replace only the lines where you read `# your solution here`. As a hint, your `equipment_measures` dataset could look something like this:

 to which the runtime averages would be:
